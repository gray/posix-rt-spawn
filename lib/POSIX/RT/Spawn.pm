=head1 NAME

POSIX::RT::Spawn - Perl interface to the posix_spawn function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use POSIX::RT::Spawn;

    my $pid = spawn 'command', 'arg1', 'arg2'
        or die "failed to spawn: $!";
    waitpid $pid, 0;
    die "command failed with status: ", $?>>8 if $?;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<POSIX::RT::Spawn> module provides an interface to the posix_spawn(2)
function for creating new processes.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 spawn

    $pid = spawn 'echo', 'hello world'

Does exactly the same thing as C<system LIST>, except the parent process
does not wait for the child process to exit. Also, the return value is the
child pid on success, or false on failure.

See L<perlfunc/system> for more details.

=head1 TODO

=over

=item *

Allow the user to alter posix_spawn settings using package variables, e.g.
  $POSIX::RT::Spawn::Flags{RESETIDS} = 1
or
  $POSIX::RT::Spawn::Flags |= &POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS

=item *

Allow the user to lexically replace the ops that use fork/exec (e.g.
backticks, open, system) with versions that use posix_spawn.
